### Frontend Architecture

Built with **Next.js 14** using the App Router for optimal performance:

```typescript
// Vehicle booking component with flexible rental periods
export function BookingSystem() {
  const [rentalPeriod, setRentalPeriod] = useState<'daily' | 'weekly' | 'monthly'>('daily');

  const calculatePrice = (vehicle: Vehicle, period: string, days: number) => {
    const basePrice = vehicle.prices[period];
    const totalPrice = basePrice * (period === 'daily' ? days : period === 'weekly' ? Math.ceil(days / 7) : Math.ceil(days / 30));

    // Apply luxury discounts for longer rentals
    const discount = period === 'monthly' ? 0.15 : period === 'weekly' ? 0.08 : 0;
    return totalPrice * (1 - discount);
  };

  return (
    <BookingInterface>
      {/* Interactive vehicle selection and pricing */}
    </BookingInterface>
  );
}
```

### Fleet Management System

Implemented dynamic vehicle data management:

```typescript
// Vehicle data structure with comprehensive specifications
interface LuxuryVehicle {
  id: string;

  category: 'Luxury' | 'Sports' | 'SUV' | 'Electric';
  pricing: {
