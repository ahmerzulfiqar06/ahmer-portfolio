Built with **Next.js 14** using the App Router for optimal performance:

export function BookingForm() {
  const form = useForm<BookingData>({
    resolver: zodResolver(bookingSchema),
    defaultValues: {
      service: "",
      date: "",
      time: "",
      customerInfo: {}
    }
  });

  const onSubmit = async (data: BookingData) => {
    // Process booking with payment integration
    await processBooking(data);
  };

  return (
    <Form {...form}>
      {/* Interactive booking interface */}
    </Form>
  );
}
```

### Payment Integration

Scaffolded payment processing for multiple providers:

```typescript
// Payment processing setup
const paymentProviders = {
  stripe: {
    secretKey: process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY,
    webhookSecret: process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
  },
  paypal: {
    clientId: process.env.PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID,
    clientSecret: process.env.PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET
  }
};
```

### Email Automation

Integrated Resend API for automated notifications:

```typescript
// Automated email notifications
export async function sendBookingConfirmation(booking: Booking) {
  await resend.emails.send({
    from: 'Auto Spa <bookings@autospa.com>',
    to: booking.customerEmail,
    subject: 'Booking Confirmation - Auto Spa',
    html: generateBookingEmailTemplate(booking)
  });
}
```
